# Research Toolkit

## Getting started

Create a virtual environment one of two ways:

### `conda`

Create the environment:

`conda env create --file conda.yaml`

Activate the environment:

`conda activate rtk-env`

### `pip`

Be sure to create an environment first as this is best practice.

Install the requirements:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
